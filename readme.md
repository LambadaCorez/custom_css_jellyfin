# Custom Jellyfin CSS (Plug n' Play)

## Introduction

This repository contains a whole bunch of little CSS tweaks for the open source media program, [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin). I initially created these for my server to freshen it up and give it a unique flair, however I think the community would use these best!

This CSS package was designed to be extraordinarily customizable and expandable with ease. By using the CSS variables provided, the entire look and feel can be changed within seconds.

If you have any custom CSS that you would like to add or share, feel free to contribute!

### Changing Variables

To change variables and make it your own:
1. Open up your .css file either thru Custom CSS or your theme profile depending on how you installed it.
2. Change variables under ":root"

The top few are global variables, which are used by the variables below that, so if you want to change the majority of things, adjust the globals first. If you want to get specific with it, change the "plugin" specific variables below the globals.
